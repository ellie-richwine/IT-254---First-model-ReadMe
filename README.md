# IT-254---First-model-ReadMe
Description for the first model of the IT 254 group project before the first model is officially due.

## Main Idea ## 
Our main idea for this project was to make a study assistant tool. We intend to implement a buzzer to redirect the user when they lose focus (eventually being changed to motivational messages created by OpenAI's API and made into auditory feedback with a speaker), a camera to see the user and determine if they are beign distracted by something other than the work (eventually wanting to be able to distinguish between people passing by or people other than the users), and a timer to count down the time left in the study session. 

## Intent of Use ##
We ideally originally thought that we could use this to help ourselves focus and study, but the target audience is really anyone that needs to focus for some extended period of time and wants to be held accountable. 

## Requirements and Model Description ##
To be able to make this model work, you need an Arduino board, a computer with python installed, the Arduino IDE, a webcam, proper Arduino parts including an LED. 

## First Model ##
This first model is mainly focused on creating and training the model through Google Teachable. This took up the brunt of the assignment so far, but we also have python and Arduino code made to be able to test and run the code through the Arduino to be able to see the results. We want to be able to see if it can buzz when facing away from the camera. From here we also intend to be able to allow the user to set a timer for the study session and messages developed from OpenAi's API.

## Final Words## 
Overall, I was very happy with how this project ended up! I really liked the idea we had, and I think the team really made the idea come to life! I did most of the documentation stuff and kept stuff organized in the github, as well as making sure the team was on top of what they were supposed to do. I think I knew this project in and out, and I think the coding was really the biggest problem area for me. But Chris was very helpful and patient with me, and helped me understand what was happening in each line of the code! We worked together very well, and all did our dedicated part, and I think the final model for the time that we were given was exactly what we were picturing when we drafted the idea!
